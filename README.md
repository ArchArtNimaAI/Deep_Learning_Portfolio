# Deep Learning Portfolio
This repository contains a series of coding exercises and projects completed during my Deep Learning course. The exercises cover key deep learning concepts, from building basic neural networks to implementing advanced architectures such as, CNN, VAE, and GAN.

## Key area Covered:
+ Neural Networks: Fundamentals of artificial neural networks (ANNs)
+ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Applications in image classification, and Autoencoders
+ Generative ALgorithms: Variational Autoencoder, GAN
+ Optimization and Regularization: Techniques like Adam, SGD, dropout, and batch normalization to enhance model training.
+ Framework: The Pytorch utilized for all examples.
